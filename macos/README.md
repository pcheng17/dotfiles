# MacOS config

## `DefaultKeyBinding`

`DefaultKeyBinding.dict` is a config that I use to disable option-key symbols on MacOS. This way,
I can use the option-key in my vim keybindings. See more information about this file [here](https://superuser.com/a/942256).

Update on 1/21/2024: Turns out, there's an easier way to disable the special characters all
together, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61482531).
